This program tries to make Palindromes out of strings using insertion.
Main Class has a driver method main() and two other methods for processing strings.

Inside Main() function:
Takes a string from user.
A check is performed to see if its already a palindrome using method checkPalindrome().
If its not then method convertToPalindrome() is called.
Prints the result.

Inside checkPalindrome():
Takes in a String as a parameter.
returns true if its already a Palindrome.

Inside convertToPalindrome()
Takes in the string as a parameter.
Determines how many insertions to make it Palindromic.
Then makes that change and returns a char[].
